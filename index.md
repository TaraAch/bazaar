## Welcome to the Bazaar

The Bhadra-Teen Darwaza market spans an area that today includes a modern plaza as part of an effort to preserve the cultural heritage of the 'old city' and its historic structures. The market and its street vendors find themselves embroiled in a struggle over eviction and occupancy rights. They argue that the market is also part of the history of the place and more broadly, the city's urban identity.

Join the vendors as they walk you through this history.
