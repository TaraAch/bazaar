Originally conceived of in 1997, the Riverfront Project describes itself as an "urban transformation" project that aims to create "a meaningful waterfront environment along the banks of the Sabarmati River." The redevelopment project resulted in the mass eviction of communities that lived and worked by the banks of the river. Most communities, like Madhuben in story 1, were resettled in the far-flung suburbs of Ahmedbad. They were completely cut off from their living and working environment. Today the Riverfront, that materialized as a result of Public-Private Partnerships, has turned what was a public space into a swanky promenade that primarily caters to the Gujarati middle class. The project helps contextualize the eviction drives in the market and the larger vision of urban development that the street vendors have to contend with.
