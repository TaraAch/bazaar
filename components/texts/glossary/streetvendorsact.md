In 2014, the Indian parliament passed the bill that led to the formulation of The Street Vendors Act which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (now renamed under the new government as the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, which is in itself telling).

The act specifically enshrines the vendors' right to vend and refers to the concept of heritage natural markets i.e. markets that have organically emerged around specific urban sites and public spaces over a period of time. Despite the law being in place, eviction of the urban poor, specifically informal workers and street vendors has been rampant.
