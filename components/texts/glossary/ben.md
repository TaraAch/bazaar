Ben literally translates to sister in Gujarati. It is typically used in a semi-formally setting, as a suffix after the name, to refer to women who are not related by blood or marriage. It is the female equivalent of "bhai". Rarely do people in Gujarat refer to each other solely by their first name. 

Usage: Ratniben or Deviben, both feature in story 3.
