Harvard University's Pluralism Project describes Sufism as a mystical branch of Islam "which aims to attain mystical knowledge and love of God through meditative practices or *dhikr*, ethical cultivation, and purification of the heart and self. Though Sufism began with individuals, Sufi communities, or tariqahs, were formed around them providing a template for spiritual guidance. Poetry, art, liturgies, biographical and philosophical works, and other forms of Sufi literature were also produced. Today, Muslims practice Sufism in a variety of modes and mediums."
