Teen Darwaza is a medieval gateway in the 'old' city of Ahmedabad that was built in 1415, during the reign of the Gujarat Sultanate. The term literally translates to three doors or gateways. The old city was also known as the 'walled city' for its numerous gateways that served as points of entry and fortified the city from the surrounding area.
