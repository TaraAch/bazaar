title: Heart of (the) city- Memories of Eviction and Belonging
---

Like most days, it is a busy day at the Bhadra-Teen Darwaza market. Business hasn’t quite picked up yet but there is a steady stream of temple-goers and passersby eyeing the various stalls. Many have brought their children along with them to do a darshan (pray) at the temple. On their way out, as promised, a pit-stop at the *imli* (tamarind) and *mukhwaas* (a sort of refreshing after-meal, palate cleanser consisting of fennel, sugar, seeds etc.) carts is a must. I gingerly introduce myself as a student who is interested in knowing more about the market and the surrounding area. Most vendors are busy trying to attract customers and get on with their day. Yet, to my surprise, there is always time for a brief chat. No one seems to be in a hurry or bothered by me interrupting their work day. A group of older, male vendors gather and it is decided that Surendra*bhai* (brother) is the best person to speak to. “He knows the whole history from A to Z.”
