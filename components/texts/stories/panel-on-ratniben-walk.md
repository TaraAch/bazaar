title: "A tour of the Bhadra fort with Ratniben"
---
As we enter the fort, Ratniben points to a carving of a hand which is now adorned with vermilion. “This is the hand of Bhadrakali.” People come here and pay their respects. The Bhadra fort was built by Ahmed Shah I, founder of the Gujarat Sultanate and the city and there is no evidence the hand carving at the entrance of the fort or its name was in honor of Bhadrakali, the mother goddess. It is possible that this new meaning was acquired during Maratha rule in the 18th century. Regardless, in present day India, this is how people choose to interact with the structure.

Ever since the fort came under the administration of the Archaeological Survey of India and was declared a UNESCO heritage site, the vendors were pushed out of its premises. As we walk in, however, we find that there is a pandāl (marquee or pavilion) for the Ganpati festival to celebrate the birth of the elephant-headed God, most beloved of the Hindus. The pavilion, inside this historic Indo-Islamic fort overlooks the Bhadra fort tower with a now defunct colonial-era clock. For all the talk of preserving the heritage and historical sanctity of these structures, which makes evicting street-vendors imperative, it seems historical structures morph, acquire meanings and are used in varied ways all the time. It just requires permission from the right person higher-up. “We get permission from the ASI. It comes from New Delhi. There is a big office in Delhi and the permission comes from there. They don't mind us using the space for festivals and programmes, but we have to get permission,” the two middle-aged men running the show inform me

Ratniben introduces me to the men and per usual, she has known them since they were little. They are members of the Bhadra Patharna Bazaar Samiti, an unofficial organization of street vendors that organize community events for fellow vendors and all who frequent the area. The group was set up in 1982 and this is their way of giving back to the area. “We organize community events during festivals. Around Navratri (a nine-day festival honoring the mother goddess) we usually do a big bhandāra, where we feed everyone for free.” We let the men continue with the Ganpati proceedings. Ratniben wants to show me Pir Bapa Nu Mandir. What she refers to as a mandir or temple is a dargah or Sufi shrine dedicated to Jilanipur Baghdadi. It is all the same, Ratniben quips, as she removes her footwear and does a namaste to pay her respect to the Sufi Pir (saint).

“I’ll take your leave but tomorrow you should get in touch with my brother’s daughter. She is a big leader for all of us.”
