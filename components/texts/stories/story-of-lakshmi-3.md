title: Lakshmi and the Market/ The Market as Lakshmi
---
Apart from an insistence on religious syncretism, the story of Lakshmi is also central to what binds Ahmedabadis across caste, religion and class- *dhandho* or business. The Lakshmi story is part of this self-mythologizing. But it is also much more.
Although it is rooted in a much longer history, predating the Ahmedabad Municipality and the contemporary politics of urban displacement, one can’t help but think of this marking of territory as a challenge to state-centric definitions of public space and spatiality. The story of Lakshmi and, to some extent, the statue of the baronet is a way of physically anchoring the history of the market in the history of the space. The Sufi shrines and temples surrounding the Bhadra fort represent the vendors’ everyday routines and relationship with the place. These shrines and stories are a way of saying “I am from here, can’t you see?” How does one explain this sense of belonging to a Municipality official? An aged bangle-seller tells me,“They ask us what proof do you have that this place belongs to you? Do you have any *dastavez* (documents) or is this your father’s *jagir* (fiefdom).” He can’t point to the Lakshmi story as “proof” that he belongs here because Lakshmi willed it, but I know he feels it in his bones.
