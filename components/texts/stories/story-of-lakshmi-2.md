title: "Lakshmi and the Sultan's Guard"
---

So it goes, that Goddess Lakshmi was leaving the city (some say she was entering- as we will see this liminality is very much the point!) when Sultan Ahmed Shah’s *kotwal* or royal guard spotted her. Plot points remain fuzzy. Some say that the guard asked her to wait until he could bring the Sultan to her. Others say he saw her leaving and urged her to stay before the gates of the city close for the day. The Goddess was about to slip away into the night when, in a bid to compel Goddess Lakshmi to stay, the guard sacrificed his life on the very spot where the shrine stands today. To honour his life, Lakshmi decided to stay on, her presence forever bestowing the area with ever-lasting prosperity. From mill-work to self-employment, from rural farm-hand to urban migrant, new mother to community leader, the market and the goddess crafts destinies. 
Someone else told me that last bit never happened. Regardless, the story of Lakshmi lives on in one form or another- less through words and more through hidden talismans around the market. You may miss them. Only those who wish to see can find them.
