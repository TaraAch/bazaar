# About The Bhadra-Teen Darwaza market

The municipality vehicles have been circling the market for months. Matters came to a head around Navratri, a major Gujarati festival involving nine nights of celebration and dance in praise of the Mother Goddess.  The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) vans carried out mass evictions, confiscating the vendors’ products, their tarpaulin sheets and the umbrellas that protect their makeshift stalls. After months of simmering tensions, this was the last straw for the women vendors who decided to take matters into their own hands. Summoning all their strength, they managed to climb into the vans to retrieve their belongings. What is, to the vendors, taking back what is rightfully theirs, is, in the eyes of the law, theft and damage to public property. Threats of criminal cases being slapped and detainment temporarily shook the women’s resolve. Surrounded by AMC men, the women tried to think of the next course of action. This is serious. And scary. 

This is when a group of hijras (transwomen organized into “families” with a “guru”/mother and disciples/children- collectively referred to as hijras) who frequent the Bhadrakāli (mother goddess) temple in the area, enter the scene. They resort to the usual routine of bawdy jokes and teasing designed to catch men off-guard and compel them to part with some loose change. They soon realize they must up the ante. This performance is different.  Almost in unison, the hijras lift their blouses and skirts and cavort around the AMC officials. The vans quickly leave the area and the women alone. The women and the vendors of the Bhadra-Teen Darwaza bazaar have a few days’ reprieve. The protracted court case, the police complaints and the next round of evictions can wait—perhaps until the end of this festive season. The vendors’ struggle with the Municipal Corporation will continue. But it is for another day. 

Ever since the Bhadra Plaza Project was implemented, eviction drives at the bazaar have become routinized. The Project was initiated by the Heritage wing of the Ahmedabad Municipality, the city's preeminent architects and urban planners as part of an effort to preserve Ahmedabad's historic sites from the hustle-bustle (read: riff-raff) of modern urban life. The plaza, a paved area around the circumference of the Bhadra fort was built to reduce vehicular traffic and overcrowding. It seems to have, however, singled out street vendors as the target and root cause of urban degradation that threatens the preservation of the city's heritage sites.

In October 2025, the Gujarat High Court brought the ongoing legal battle between the street vendors' union and the Municipal Corporation to a temporary resolution (or impasse depending on how you see it) by issuing an interim order that requires the street vendors to vacate the premises and relocate to a nearby area. Among other things the street vendors were accused of posing a "law and order" problem. Although the judgement will likely be appealed, the market as shown and described here, no longer exists for the time being.
